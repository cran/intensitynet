}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{intensitynetMix object}

\item{node_id}{ID of the node}
}
\value{
mean intensities of the given node for undirected edges, in and out directed and total intensity.
}
\description{
Given a node, calculates its mean intensities depending on the edges associated with the node, those intensities are: 
in, out (for directed edges), undirected and total intensity.
