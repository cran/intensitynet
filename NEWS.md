# intensitynet 1.3.0

* Added option to function 'PlotHeatmap' plot a heatmap based on marks.

* Added a new argument 'net_edges' to the function 'PlotHeatmap'. Now the user can specify which nodes and edges want to plot.

* Added option to function 'plot' to plot a path by giving its vertices using the new argument 'path'.

* Changed function name 'ShortestPathIntensity' to 'ShortestPath'.

* Added option to 'ShortestPath' to calculate the shortest path based on the given weight type with the new argument 'weight'.

* Changed function name 'PathIntensity' to 'PathTotalWeight'

* Now the function 'PathTotalWeight' gives the total specified weight for the given path (or the number of edges if no weight is specified).

* Changed heatmap colors and increased edge and vertex size to visualize better the plots.


# intensitynet 1.2.0

* Added new functionality. Now the package can work with covariates (numerical, categorical, or both). Each edge in the graph provided by the intensitynet object contains all the information of its associated events.  

* Changed internal function name 'AllEdgeIntensities()' to 'EdgeIntensitiesAndProportions()'  In order to adapt its meaning to the new functionalities.

* Changed function name 'CalculateEventIntensities()' to 'RelateEventsToNetwork()'. In order to adapt its meaning to the new functionalities.

* Greatly reduced the computational time to calculate event-related intensities with the function 'RelateEventsToNetwork()'.



# intensitynet 1.1.0

* Modified DESCRIPTION name references 'IntensityNet' to 'intensitynet' to match the package name.

* Added option to select event the error distance. Now the user can determine the maximum distance from an event to an edge to be considered part of that edge.

* Added an option to the plots ('plot' and 'PlotHeatmap' functions) to also plot the events. The events will be displayed as orange squares.

* Fixed bug when using the 'plot()' function with intensitynet objects which showed properly the axis in a .pdf but not in a dynamic plot.
